        <p>Heists of Bengal is an action-adventure game about banditry in the Rarh region of the Bengal Presidency. The game is primarily set in Dhanbad, Burdwan, and Assensol.
          <br>
          <br>1866-1882 (backstory): The main character, Rudra Majumdar, was born in Howrah. His father, Subhokar Majumdar, a peasant, was killed by the British authorities for allegedly supporting the Indian independence movement. Subsequently, Rudra and his mother moved to his maternal grandparents' house in Burdwan. Unfortunately, his mother died due to cholera. Subsequently, his maternal grandparents' abandoned him. A famous bandit in the Rarh region of Bengal named Kabir Yadav included Rudra in his gang, Agniveer, when he found him in the streets.
          <br>
          <br>The gang primarily looted jewellery from the Zamindar's houses and coal from trains, selling them on the black market.
          <br>

          </a>
          <br>1897 (present): After 15 years of staying in the gang, Rudra had become a very skilled bandit. Unfortunately, an investigation team led by Samir Mallah, the sub-inspector for the Burdwan Police, caught Kabir and shot him on the spot.  After Kabir's death, the gang fled to Dhanbad. After arriving in Dhanbad, Rudra was made the leader of the gang. The gang included co-leader Gulab Yadav, truck driver Shakib Khan, Dilip Kumar Upadhyay, Laxman Srivastava, and black marketer Rafiqul Hassan. Rudra used to donate half of the gang's profit to the peasants.
          <br>
          <br>Rudra's dream was to make Agniveer the biggest bandit gang in Burdwan and take revenge on the British authorities. He knew that to fulfill his dream, he needed to upgrade the gang's weaponry, defeat other gangs and protect his gang from the British authorities. While waiting for a big heist, the gang looted some small merchants' houses. Consequently, the local police put a bounty on Agniveer. Shakib informed Rudra that a coal train would depart the next day from Assensole to Howrah. Subsequently, Agniveer moved to the outskirts of Assensole and started preparing for the heist.
          <br>
          <br>However, while looting the coal train, Agniveer clashed with another bandit gang, Bonbashi. Agniveer was taking heavy casualties, so they decided to retreat. Subsequently, Shakib Khan blamed Gulab Yadav for the heist's failure. Even though Rudra was a close friend of Gulab Yadav, Rudra agreed with Shakib. Gulab felt hurt by this and left the gang. Consequently, Rudra made Shakib the new co-leader. After leaving the gang, Gulab created his own gang, Shershakti, and wanted to make it the biggest bandit gang in Burdwan.
          <br>
          <br>When Agniveer looted the house of a rich merchant, Anand Lal Agarwal, his wife, Vaishnavi Devi, wanted to go with them. When she was a teenager, her father sold her to Anand. Anand was an alcoholic and beat Vaishnavi. She was made a member of Agniveer by Shakib to honey-trap people since she is beautiful and intelligent. The Inspector General of Police in Bengal, Arthur Johnson, appointed Jai Singh Rathore, a detective and a former bandit, to collaborate with the local police stations in the Rarh region. Jai's mission was to find Agniveer and Shershakti.
          <br>
          <br>He was recruited as a detective to find bandits after getting arrested by the Calcutta Police. While returning from a successful heist, Rudra saved Debolina Roy, a Hindustani Classical singer, from Raju Mahato, a bandit of the Bonbashi gang, who was harassing her. Debolina had come to Burdwan from Calcutta to perform for the Zamindar of Burdwan. Debolina later became Rudra's love interest. Khoka Ghosh, a former railway engineer, wanted to join Agniveer. Rudra accepted Khoka as the new member of the gang, but Shakib had mixed feelings about Khoka.
          <br>
          <br>Khoka's love interest was Simran Oberoi, a dance teacher. Khoka introduced Rudra to Hridoy Chakraborty, a former professor at Calcutta University who used to teach Khoka. Hridoy started admiring Rudra's work and allowed Rudra's gang to use his farmhouse in Vishnupur as their primary hiding spot. Khudabaksh Akhter, a short-tempered man who had a good track record of catching bandits, became the new police inspector at the Assensole Police Station after getting transferred from the Ghaziabad Police Station.
          <br>
          <br>Jitendra Bagchi, an Inspector for the Burdwan Police, had a meeting with Khudabaksh, Jai, and Aniruddho Mondal, an Inspector for the Manbazar Police. In the meeting, they discussed about the rise of banditry. When the cases of coal banditry started rising significantly, the railway companies upgraded the security of the coal trains by employing officers to guard them. Consequently, looting coal trains became harder for Agniveer, as they had to defeat the officers before looting.
          <br>
          <br>After many Zamindars and british officers started complaining about banditry, Arthur was pressured by Lord Wilson, the Viceroy of India, to capture the bandits quickly. Many Zamindars are also complaining to the British Indian government. Wilson is very stubborn and many people despise him because he failed to prevent the Bengal famine. (To be continued)
